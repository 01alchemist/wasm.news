If this page looks familiar to you it may be because you've already seen my main project [JS.ORG](https://js.org). While I just reused the layout of the page, the topic is quite different. No more JavaScript but WebAssembly all over.<!--more-->

WebAssembly - or <strong>wasm</strong> for short - is a new binary syntax for low-level code on the web platform; and this website acts as a news aggregator on the topic.

If you are interested to contribute a post, feel free to do so. The site is hosted on GitHub using the static site generator Jekyll; it would only require you to make a pull request with your link or content in a markdown file. Have a look at the <a href="/contributing.html">how-to</a>.

WASM.NEWS is a branch of the <a href="https://js.org">JS.ORG</a> initiative. Until JavaScript gets overtaken by WebAssembly you may also want to have a look at <a href="http://news.js.org">NEWS.JS.ORG</a>.
